<h1>Blood Pressure Plot Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This Python project processes blood pressure and pulse data collected over a specified range of dates and times. The program accepts two user-defined arguments, along with a CSV file containing the dataset. The data is passed into a dedicated class, where it undergoes analysis and normalization to group the values effectively. Key statistical metrics, including average, minimum, and maximum values, are calculated to provide meaningful insights. The processed data is then visualized through a graph, with the x- and y-axis parameters dynamically set within the Python program to ensure accurate representation.
